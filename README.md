# Bowling Score Keeper.

This game is based on the bowling score rules to provide a correct display and calculation of bowling score oer 10 frames.

When you press Roll, you receive a random number between 0 - 10, this score is then added together with your coming rolls, until you have filled all the frames.

It is built with JavaScript and jQuery.

I wanted to have a dynamic logic, and choose to work with objects that are updates based on the result. The trickiest part was to look back and update the frame that had a strike, with the score from the two consecutive rolls. 

But adding a boolean for if the last roll was a strike or not, also with keeping a strike calculator, I could calculate how many rolls after to add points to. Altough, the logic breaks if there are more than two strikes in a row, which I could not manage to get my head around within the time frame.

The work itself took me about 4-5 hours in total.

About 1 hour of understanding the rules of bowling(hehe).
1/2 hour of building the logic.
2 hours of building the app.
2 hour of fixing errors and getting the work complete working.
excluding time for understanding the rules of bowling, which took me about an hour.

Having never known the rules of bowling, it was a bit tricky in the beginning to get how all the parts work. I would say that the instructions for the task does not really make clear how the rules of bowling work, unless you have a basic idea of it already. So, some feedback for you who gave me this task to think about. Other than that, it was a nice and tricky challenge, and I had fun doing it.

The next step would be to make a visual interpretation of this, which I would be excited about.
